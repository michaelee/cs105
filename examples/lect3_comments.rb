# Here are some more sample comments

puts (10+9+8+9+10)/5 # print out the average of 5 numbers

puts 30*365*24*60*60 # print out my approximate age in seconds

=begin
This here's a comment that runs across multiple lines.

It begins with the text "=begin" at the beginning of a line and ends 
with the text "=end" at the beginning of a line.

You can pretty much write anything you want here.  None of it will
be "interpreted" by the Ruby interpreter.
=end

# Say bye!
puts "Bye"

# Remember, you can have as many comments as you wish, spliced in between
# lines of Ruby code.
